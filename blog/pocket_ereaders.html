<h3>installing apps</h3>
because the device doesn't have google play services, you have to side load apps.

<h3>apps that I use regularly on my hisense touch—</h3>
<ul>
    <li>aio launcher: my favorite android launcher</li>
    <li>unlauncher: my second favorite android launcher</li>
    <li>mAbook: fantastic audiobook player, unfortunately you have to install a cracked apk as purchasing the full version requires google play services</li>
    <li>anki: i enjoy studying japanese and reviewing decks on my android devices</li>
    <li>syncthing: useful for automatically syncing files between my computers and android devices</li>
    <li>tachiyomi: great manga reading app</li>
    <li>moon+ reader pro: pretty solid android e-reader app. not optimized for e-ink but works well enough. I've also tested koreader, which is optimized for eink, but find the interface displeasing. technically it's a more powerful app, and it's also open source—I should probably switch to koreader.</li>
    <li>spotify: works as expected, interface is dark but usable</li>
 </ul>
